# JokesWebApp

My first ASP.NET MVC application with CRUD features.

This is a simple app which allows user to register a profile and create, read, update and delete(CRUD) jokes, and also consists a search feature based on a keyword. I have used MS SQL server to host the database. You need to create an account to create, edit or delete a joke. You can view the jokes as a guest!

This is home page.
